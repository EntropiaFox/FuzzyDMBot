###RollGramBot

This is a Telegram Bot that can store custom dice rolls for different users and roll them on command. It can also roll unsaved rolls on the fly.

It uses node.js + mongoDB on the server side and is made possible by the [node-telegram-bot](https://github.com/depoio/node-telegram-bot) project.
